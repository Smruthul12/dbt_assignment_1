The model includes the following columns: 'CustomerID', 'Country', 'last_purchase_date', and 'customer_segment'. The 'CustomerID' column is used as a unique identifier for each customer. The 'Country' column represents the country where the customer is located. The 'last_purchase_date' column represents the most recent date the customer made a purchase. The 'customer_segment' column represents the segment the customer belongs to based on their purchasing behavior."

  - name: rfm_segmentation
    description: The rfm_segmentation model is used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It uses the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) methodology to score customers on a scale of 1 to 5 for each of the three categories. The model then segments customers into 'Best Customers', 'Loyal Customers', 'New Customers', 'At Risk Customers', 'Lost Customers', and 'Others' based on their scores. The model uses data from the retail_cleansed table in the Retail_Analytics_dbt.DEV schema.
