models:
  - name: retail_cleansed
    description: "The 'retail_cleansed' model is a transformation of the 'raw_retail' table from the 'Retail_Analytics_dbt.DEV' database. It includes the following columns: 'InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description', 'Quantity', 'InvoiceDate', 'UnitPrice', 'CustomerID', and 'Country'. The 'Description' and 'Country' columns are transformed to upper case and trimmed of any leading or trailing spaces. The 'InvoiceDate' is cast to a date format and 'UnitPrice_str' is cast to a float format and renamed to 'UnitPrice'. The model filters out records where 'CustomerID' is null and 'Quantity' is less than or equal to zero."
